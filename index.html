          <text class="lead">We are the developers of MCS(Medical Care System). We are testing our first developments, a robot medical assistant. Our team consists of two people. We are moving very fast. New ideas for developing our devices are constantly coming. Not far off is the day when we launch our devices in mass production!</text>

            <text class="lead">Now we have developed 2 devices: a medical assistant robot and a band for measuring
              health.
              These devices have a special app that receives data about your health.</text>

            <text class="lead">
              <li>1.Affordable price: The price of a robot and our device is affordable for everyone. Such
                unusual functionality for such an unusual price.</li>

              <li>2. A wide platform of devices: a robot and a bracelet are very small devices in size, but despite
                this
                they
                have a lot of functionality. The robot has 4 skills in its arsenal:

                <ul>1) Distribution of medicines in case of illness;</ul>

                <ul>2) Sending health data to a special application. Thanks to this application, you will always know
                  your
                  health status.</ul>

                <ul>3) Tips and tricks to help you stay alert!</ul>

                <ul>4) In case of danger or with a serious diagnosis, prompt notification to the hospital.</ul>
              </li>

              <li>3. The smart watch device also has great functionality:

                <ul>1) Tracking your health status.</ul>

                <ul>2) Thanks to the application, you will also always be in the know about your health.</ul>

                <ul>3) Like a robot, the device will deliver your health data if necessary.</ul>

                <ul>4) And the most important thing is the size. Such a small device and such an irreplaceable
                  assistant!
                </ul>

            hospitals. It also advises which medicines to take, what see a doctor.

          <h1>ROBOT</h1>
          <h2 class="display-4">Robot</h2>
          <text class="lead"><b>Robot. For whom and what is it for?</b><br>
            As we said earlier, our robot is designed for people with disabilities, patients of medical institutions and it is an excellent assistant for medical workers. The robot can perform its functions not only in medical institutions, hospitals and clinics, but also in an apartment or house.
            <b>>Robot oportunities</b><br>
            The name of the robot contains “Medical Assistant”. This means that the robot performs almost all the functions of a medical worker. The robot can dispense medication, medicine, and bulk medicine. You enter your health data (temperature, pressure, pulse) into the robot's program. The robot assesses your health and dispenses the right pills and the right bulk medicines. Also, if the robot detects poor health, it will send a signal to an ambulance. The robot calculates statistics about your health and if your condition worsens every day, after 3 days the robot will notify the hospital or your doctor about it. There is a help button at work. And if you suddenly feel sick, when you press a button, the robot calls an ambulance. You can also view your health status in a special application developed by us and on the Medical Care System website. A little about the system.
            <b>Our system</b><br>
            Our system represents the link between the robot and the rest of our developments. All information that the robot receives and measures about your health is synchronized with the application, the doctor and our website. Information about your health status (temperature, pressure, pulse, quantity and name of medications you took. All this can be seen in the application (which can be downloaded) and on the website (in the patient's personal account). Your doctor can also assess your condition and prescribe the necessary medications.Also, the doctor can go to the patient's personal account and see all the information about him. (We also want to make it possible to send messages to the patient).
            Plus and <strike>minuses</strike><br>
            <li>
            <ul> The robot is easy to use. No special skills required to use it<br></ul>
            <ul> Small size, big possibilities. The robot has the functionality of a medical worker and is not large in size.</ul><br>
            <ul> Better than your competitors. Complete autonomy, connection with the application and the MCS website.</ul><br>
            <ul> Communication with the medical institution, doctor and patient. The robot can send all data to your doctor.</ul><br>
            <ul>Communication with the patient's personal account on the MCS website.</ul><br>
          </li>
            
            <b>Why are we better than competitors?</b><br>
            Our robot has full autonomy. And the link to the site and application. People with disabilities and hospital patients do not have to have special skills to control the robot. The robot can travel to medical facilities, or it can stand next to one patient and dispense the necessary medications. Thus, our robot can be suitable for different purposes and can be an excellent assistant for the patient.</text>
